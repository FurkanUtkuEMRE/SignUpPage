# sign-up-page

Sign up page which includes a form to get user information. Form checks if the data entered is correct.

Designed using HTML, CSS and JS only.

JS has only been used for checking if two password are matching. Some responsivity was added, however this project is not tested on too many device emulations, therefore some accessibility issues can occur on smaller devices.
